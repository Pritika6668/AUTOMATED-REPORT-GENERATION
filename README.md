## Description:
The "Automated Report Generation" project is a practical application of Python programming designed to automate the process of reading, analyzing, and presenting data in a professional report format. This system takes a dataset in CSV format, processes it to generate useful statistics and visual representations, and finally outputs a formatted PDF report containing both the numerical insights and graphs.

This project eliminates the need for manual report preparation, which is often time-consuming and error-prone. With this automation, users can consistently generate accurate and professional reports in a matter of seconds.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python 3
- Libraries Used:
  - pandas for data manipulation and analysis
  - matplotlib for plotting visual graphs
  - fpdf or reportlab for creating PDF reports
- Code Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
- Operating System: Windows 11
  
##  Features Implemented

1. CSV Data Input:
   - The system reads structured data (marks in subjects) from a .csv file.
 2.  Data Analysis:
   - Calculates key statistics such as mean, maximum, and minimum for each subject.   
3. Graph Generation:
   - Creates bar charts showing students' scores using matplotlib.
4. PDF Report Creation:
   - Compiles the summary and the graph into a professional-looking PDF file. 
5. Automation:
   - Once the script is run, all tasks are completed automatically with no user intervention requireed

##  Applicability

This task is highly applicable in:
- Educational institutions to generate student performance reports.
- Business analytics for creating sales or performance summaries.
- Research environments for producing automated data summaries.
- HR departments to create employee performance or attendance reports.
- Healthcare for patient records summary generation.

It significantly reduces manual effort and ensures consistent formatting and presentation, especially when processing large datasets.
